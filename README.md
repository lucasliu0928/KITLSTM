## General info

## Setup
- Python 3.7
- Pytorch 1.7.1

## Original Data
User can request the real-world data through UK CCTS (University of Kentucky, Center for Clinical and Translational Science) with approved IRB.

## Code Sections
## Code Examples

## Hyperparameters
We choose the hyperparameters that delivered the best performance for the validation set by doing random search for all methods.
The resulting hyperparameters for KIT-LSTM in the paper are: the size of hidden states is 8, the learning rate is 0.01, the batch size is 256, the dropout rate is 0.2.

## Status
Project is: _in progress_ for final cleaning and organizing
